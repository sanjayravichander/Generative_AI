                **Discover the Hidden Gem of Obihiro, Hokkaido: A 3-Day Itinerary ðŸŒ³**

Are you looking for a laid-back city in Japan that offers a unique blend of peaceful parks, delicious regional cuisine, and a slower, more local side of Japan? Look no further than Obihiro, located on the south side of Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost prefecture. In this 3-day itinerary, I'll show you what to do, what to eat, where to stay, and how to get around this charming town.

**Day Zero: Arrival and Dinner in Obihiro**

We arrived in Obihiro from Tokyo in the evening and checked into our hotel. For dinner, we walked 15 minutes to Hamasui, a casual Japanese conveyor belt sushi restaurant. This affordable option offers a wide array of fresh sushi, and I highly recommend checking out their seasonal menu.

**Day One: Exploring Obihiro**

After breakfast at Masuya Mokoto Bakery, a local bakery that makes bread exclusively from wheat grown in the Tokachi area, I took a 30-minute bus ride to Kofuku Station, a closed train station that remains a popular tourist destination spot. The views of the best fields and the old train cars are a must-see.

Next, I visited the Sugar Beat Museum, which showcases the sugar beet industry's influence on Obihiro's development. After the museum, I walked 12 minutes to a nearby mall to pick up some clothing items at Uniqlo. Finally, I ended the day with a delicious miso Ramen dinner at Kiri A Ramen Holand restaurant.

**Day Two: More Obihiro Delights**

After breakfast in my hotel room, I took a bus to Obihiroshi Yasen, a beautiful botanical garden known for its wild grass. Next, I visited the Hokkaido Opo Art Museum to check out the current photography exhibit. For lunch, I walked around the park and sat in front of the Obihiro Centennial Hall, where I enjoyed the rest of my bread from the bakery.

In the afternoon, I visited the iconic Mega Don Quijote, a discount shopping destination that carries thousands of Japanese products at affordable prices. After shopping, I enjoyed lunch at Curry Shop Indian Machaka, a Japanese curry restaurant located within the Don Quijote building.

**Day Three: Last Day in Obihiro**

After checking out of my hotel, I had breakfast at Three Standard Coffee, located inside the Obihiro JR station. I treated myself to coffee and suet pancakes, which were perfectly not too sweet. Next, I met with my husband and his tour group, and we took a 30-minute bus ride to Manab Garden, a charming Str-style garden featuring distinct botanical areas with views of wild Hokkaido birds and playful squirrels.

For lunch, we enjoyed a peaceful meal at the Garden Cafe, where we indulged in delicious gallettes. Finally, we ended our trip with a last-minute meal at At Bhah Ha, known for its specialty Hokkaido dish, Bhadon.

**Travel Tips for Obihiro**

* **Where to Stay:** I highly recommend staying at Hotel Nio Northland Obihiro, located in the center of Obihiro City. It's conveniently located next to Obihiro JR station and several bus stops, including the airport bus.
* **How to Get Around:** You can get around easily using the public bus transportation. I recommend downloading the Japan Transit Planner app and purchasing a 1-day Obihiro bus pass each day.

**Conclusion**

Obihiro, Hokkaido, is a hidden gem that offers a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. With its peaceful gardens, delicious local cuisine, and easy public transportation, this charming town is a perfect spot for a peaceful and authentic Japanese getaway.
